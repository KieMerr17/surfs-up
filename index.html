            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <br>
            <p>We are a family run business based in Siargao, Philippine. With over 30 years experience
                working in the surfing industry, this has grown to become the no.1 place to come to for 
                surfing lessons whilst in Siargao.
            </p>
            <p>We opened the School in 1994 following working for another company because we decided we 
                could give our students a much better experience, and we have never looked back!
