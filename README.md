## Design

### Design Choices
The webpage was designed with a simplicity feel to give the user a quick and easy navigation to specific sections for relevant information.

### Colours
For the colour scheme i used sandy tones and deep blues to give the same feel you would expect to have being on a beach or in the water. My inspiration for the colors was taken from a Pintrest colour pallet which i felt delivered just what i was looking for. The colors were given in basic '#' color codes but i converted them to RGB and RGBA to give some areas some opacity.
<br>

![Colour scheme](docs/features/color-palette.jpg)


### Fonts
Oswald Font was used across the page to match in with the simplicity feel i was looking to acheive in the design period.
<br>
Sans-serif was used as a back-up font should Oswald not be available.

### Structure
The page is structured in a well know, recognizable, user friendly, and easy to learn way. When arriving to the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar with the company name on the left side and the navigation links to the right. 


The website consists of three separate pages: 
- A Home Page with a section to give information about the company, lesson types we offer and also the surf forecast for this week.
- A Gallery page with images to display content from previous lesson where photos were taken.
- A Sign Up page with a sign-up form, a map along with information about how and where to contact the business.

## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|When clicking 'Submit' on the signup.html page, the link is broken and doesnt take you to any page | Created a page to thank people for signing up and from there they can navigate back to either of the menu links|
|Main logo header text was splitting and dropping down to another line when viewed on x-small screens | Adjusted padding left on main header to allow logo to stay on one line|

### Code

I referenced the HTML and CSS from the Love Running project for social links at the footer section of the page, i feel it fitted well with the design i was looking to acheive on the site. 

I used Google Maps for the embedded Map on the Signup.html page.
