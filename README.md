## Design

### Design Choices
The webpage was designed with a simplicity feel to give the user a quick and easy navigation to specific sections for relevant information.

### Colours
For the colour scheme i used sandy tones and deep blues to give the same feel you would expect to have being on a beach or in the water.tones were chosen to match the images on the page and also the colour theme of the actual restaurant. My inspiration for the colors was taken from a Pintrest colour pallet which i felt delivered just what i was looking for. The colors were given in basic '#' color codes but i converted them to RGB and RGBA to give some areas some opacity.
<br>

### Fonts
Oswald Font was used across the page to match in with the simplicity feel i was looking to acheive in the design period.
<br>
Sans-serif was used as a back-up font should Oswald not be available.

### Structure
The page is structured in a well know, recognizable, user friendly, and easy to learn way. When arriving to the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar with the company name on the left side and the navigation links to the right. 


The website consists of three separate pages: 
- A Home Page with a section to give information about the company, lesson types we offer and also the surf forecast for this week.
- A Gallery page with images to display content from previous lesson where photos were taken.
- A Sign Up page with a sign-up form, a map along with information about how and where to contact the business.
