# Surfs Up #

Surfs Up is a website designed to give avid surfers or budding enthusiasts a place to sign up to undertake some surf coaching. The site gives people based on the island of Siargao a reference to where surf coaching is available and where it will be depending on surf conditions that day.

The site will give the company a platform to showcase their business through photos, displaying packages they offer, and will also give people the option to sign up to learn at their school.
